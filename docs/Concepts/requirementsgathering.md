# Requirements Gathering

[Resource - Software Requirements](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_engineering/software_requirements.htm)  

## Requirements Gathering Steps
1. Identify Stakeholders and Roles
- List all key stakeholders (e.g., clients, end-users, developers, managers)
- Define roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder
- Create a stakeholder communication plan

2. Define Project Goals and Objectives
- Outline the overall purpose of the application
- List specific business goals the application should achieve
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring success

3. Conduct Stakeholder Interviews
- Prepare interview questions focusing on needs, pain points, and expectations
- Schedule and conduct interviews with key stakeholders
- Document and analyze interview findings

4. Gather Functional Requirements
- List all required features and functionalities
- Describe user interactions and system behaviors
- Create user stories or use cases for each major function

5. Define Non-Functional Requirements
- Specify performance requirements (e.g., load times, concurrent users)
- Outline security requirements and compliance needs
- Determine scalability and reliability expectations
- List compatibility requirements (browsers, devices, etc.)

6. Create User Personas and Scenarios
- Develop detailed user personas representing target audience segments
- Write user scenarios describing typical interactions with the application

7. Outline Technical Requirements
- Specify required technologies, frameworks, and platforms
- Define integration requirements with existing systems
- List any specific development or deployment constraints

8. Design Initial Wireframes or Prototypes
- Create low-fidelity wireframes for key pages/features
- Develop interactive prototypes if necessary
- Use these visual aids to validate requirements with stakeholders

9. Prioritize Requirements
- Categorize requirements (e.g., must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)
- Use techniques like MoSCoW method for prioritization
- Create a prioritized backlog of features and requirements

10. Document and Validate Requirements
- Compile all gathered information into a comprehensive requirements document
- Include functional specifications, technical requirements, and user stories
- Review and validate the document with all key stakeholders

11. Plan for Requirement Management
- Establish a process for tracking and updating requirements
- Define how changes to requirements will be handled during development
- Set up tools for requirement tracking and version control

12. Conduct a Final Review
- Hold a final review meeting with all stakeholders
- Address any remaining questions or concerns
- Obtain formal sign-off on the requirements document
